# APItesting
Automation for API

## Notes

At this point tests are properly running when run individually from each test class.
The base endpoint used is: https://602b2e9def26b40017f1405d.mockapi.io/mock/api/bank/
The POJO initialization was made using a second mockapi resource using the endpoint: https://602b2e9def26b40017f1405d.mockapi.io/mock/api/randomUsers
